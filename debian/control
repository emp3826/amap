Description: next-generation scanning tool for pentesters
 AMAP stands for Application MAPper. It is a next-generation scanning
 tool for pentesters. It attempts to identify applications even if they
 are running on a different port than normal.
 .
 It also identifies non-ascii based applications. This is achieved by
 sending trigger packets, and looking up the responses in a list of
 response strings.
